Stories is the application I've done for the WWDC16, with theme of coding, darkness but lights with a moon that guide you through an interactive story full of animations, transitions, design and Swift.

## The app

The app is an interactive story that will change based on your answers. With two options every now an then appearing after the text types itself. A part from that, you'll be able to select whatever you want to select from a menu that comes beautifully with some animations. Scroll through the story of the app or the motivation behind it.
