I didn't have an app to show, I didn't have time to build one, what should I do? I started contacting my friends around the world to pitch ideas, a guy from Portugal, a person from Catalonia, another from Australia...\n\nTogether we came out with an idea to make an app for celiac people, as my sister and me, to explain people what it is like to or to eat Gluten Free products, put ResearchKit in it and make a kick ass app in just 2 weeks...\n\nAfter that, though, I started thinking, I was working, so didn't have much more time to put on it, but still, when I got home, I wasn't convinced at all.\n\nTo explain my disease to the world I wanted to do something great, I couldn't do it in a week spending some afternoons...\n\nI was desperate, I started drawing some stuff, I was worried because I couldn't show you Lights, my biggest side project yet, since it includes hardware. But then it hit me.";
